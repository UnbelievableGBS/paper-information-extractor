## Abstract
We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings, and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians 𝐻0 defined by ⟦𝑁,𝐾,𝑑⟧ LDPC codes, which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance 𝑑≥𝑐⁢log﻿(𝑁), implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states—these include good quantum LDPC codes and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasilocal on the interaction graph defined by 𝐻0 and that can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the 𝑂⁡(1) smallest eigenvalues of 𝐻0. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has 2𝐾 states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth 𝛿=𝐶⁢𝑁⁢𝑒−Θ⁡(𝑑), which is tighter than the best-known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground-state subspace is related to the initial-code subspace by a quasilocal unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.
