## Abstract
We propose a resource-efficient shadow-tomography scheme using equatorial-stabilizer measurements generated from subsets of Clifford unitaries. For -qubit systems, equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow-tomography schemes can estimate observables (up to an additive error ) using sampling copies for a large class of observables, including those with traceless parts possessing polynomially bounded Frobenius norms. For arbitrary quantum-state observables with a constant Frobenius norm, sampling complexity becomes independent. Our scheme only requires an -depth controlled- (CZ) circuit [ CZ gates] and Pauli measurements per sampling copy. Alternatively, our scheme is realizable with -depth circuits comprising nearest-neighboring cnot gates, exhibiting a smaller maximal gate count relative to previously known randomized-Clifford-based proposals. We numerically confirm our theoretically derived shadow-tomographic sampling complexities with random pure states and multiqubit graph states. Finally, we demonstrate that equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow tomography is more noise tolerant than randomized-Clifford-based schemes in terms of fidelity estimation for the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state and W state.
